# Chart API.

Here we will show how to create a simple chart only with code. Note that
as charts are complex and have many configuration options, the best way
to find out how to create a particular chart is to create it in Excel,
and then open it with APIMate. APIMate has full support for showing
the chart API.

## Concepts

- How you can use [ExcelFile.AddChart](https://doc.tmssoftware.com/flexcel/net/api/FlexCel.Core/ExcelFile/AddChart.html), [ExcelChart.AddSeries](https://doc.tmssoftware.com/flexcel/net/api/FlexCel.Core/ExcelChart/AddSeries.html) and other commands to create a
  simple chart.

- The chart API works only in **xlsx** files, so this demo wouldn't
  work with xls files.
