# FlexView

This example shows how to import xls and xlsx files from other applications (like mail or dropbox)
into a Xamarin.iOS app using FlexCel, 
and also how to export pdf files from your app to other applications and for printing.

In order to use this sample, you need to first open a different app, like mail, locate an xls or xlsx
attachment, press "Share", and select "FlexView". FlexView will convert that file to pdf and show it in a browser.

Once you have the file in FlexView, you can export the generated pdf back to mail, or dropbox, or any
other app that can handle pdf files in your device. You can also print the pdf file.

There is a step-by-step tutorial on how this app was created available at https://download.tmssoftware.com/flexcel/doc/net/tutorials/ios-tutorial.html
