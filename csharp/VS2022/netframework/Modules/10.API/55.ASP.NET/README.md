# ASP.NET

FlexCel is not tied to any specific technology, you can use it the same
on WinForms, Xamarin, Console apps, whatever. While most of the
demos here are on WinForms for convenience, converting them to ASP or others
is really simple.

You can\'t run this demo from the well, you need to open the solution on
visual studio and deploy it from there. **If using Visual Studio 2005,**
go to File-\>Open-\>Web Site\... and select the first
\"GettingStartedCF\" folder.

## Concepts

- Once again the Getting Started demo, now running on ASP.NET.

- You can read and write files to streams, not needing to create
  temporary files. You could save the generated files directly to a
  database too.
