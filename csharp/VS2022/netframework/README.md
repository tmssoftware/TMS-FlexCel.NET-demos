# Welcome to the FlexCel Demo Browser

Hi. This is the central entry point for the FlexCel examples.

From here you can access all examples available, and when you want to study
one in particular, you can open that solution alone.

Select an item on the left, and press **Run Selected** to open the
corresponding example.

You can also search for keywords at the search box at the top. This will
search inside the descriptions, example templates and code for the
keyword, and highlight the corresponding demos. For example, if you want
to see demos using HTML, just type \"HTML\" in the search box. If you
want to find a demo that uses the \<\#lookup\> tag, type \"\<\#lookup\"
in the box.

**Note:** The first time you search the application must scan all
documents, and this might take some seconds. Once the initial scan is
done, searching should be fast.
