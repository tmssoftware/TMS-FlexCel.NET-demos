## New in v 7.7 - October 2020


- **SkiaSharp used by .NET Core updated to 2.80.2.** We've updated the .NET Core code so it uses SkiaSharp 2.80.2

- **Improved handling of unknown parts inside xlsx files and improved Google sheets compatibility.** Now FlexCel has a more solid implementation for preserving unknown parts and  relationships inside xlsx files. This fixes issues that could happen when editing xlsx files generated by google sheets.

- **Bug Fix.** When copying a sheet to a different file, ImageCount in the target file would return 0 even if there were images.

- **Bug Fix.** FlexCel wouldn't allow some unicode characters in 3d formulas, while Excel would allow them.

- **Bug Fix.** Improved support for camera objects. A new property [MaxNestedCameraObjects](https://doc.tmssoftware.com/flexcel/net/api/FlexCel.Core/FlxConsts/MaxNestedCameraObjects.html) allows to specify how many times a camera object can recursively draw itself.

- **Bug Fix.** FlexCel could not read some files with deleted what-if tables.
